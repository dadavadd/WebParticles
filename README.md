A captivating C# Windows Forms application that brings a dynamic and interactive particle system to your desktop! ✨

## About The Project

WebParticles is a simple yet enchanting desktop application built with C# and Windows Forms. It simulates a field of glowing particles that move, connect, and react to user interaction.
